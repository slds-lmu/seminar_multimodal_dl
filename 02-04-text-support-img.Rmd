# Chapter 2.4 Text supporting computer vision models

*Author: Max Schneider*

*Supervisor: Jann Goschenhofer*

## Intro

The text supported CV architectures presented in this chapter follow the spirit of <!-- ref to other chapter mentioning NLP progress -->.
This means, they stem from a line of research which takes a lot of inspiration from preceding advancements in NLP.
The aim is the incorporation of respective new findings into CV in order to improve the SOTA in this field, which has to main aspects:

1. Researchers try to translate architectural concepts firstly used in NLP to the CV scenario, e.g., the vision transformer <!-- ref -->.
1. They leverage the power of these NLP models as building blocks inside bigger models, where they are used as text encoders for models where natural language is used as a very compelling source of supervision.

This chapter is dedicated mainly to the second.
It has subchapters on the recent and relevant CV models CLIP, ALIGN, Florence, ... and discusses some of their core concepts related to natural language supervision. <!-- ref for all papers --> \
For example, all the architectures employ some form of transformer-based language encoder [@vaswani2017attention] and CLIP excels even more when using a vision transformer as its image encoder. <!-- ref vision transformer -->
They confirm that the potential, impressively demonstrated by models like GPT-3 [@brown2020language], of this relatively recent architecture type is relevant for CV. \
But language models like BERT <!-- ref BERT --> and GPT-3 have a big impact on another aspect of their field:
They become to serve as so called foundation models, future architectures use them as building blocks. <!-- ref to foundation model paper, ref to DALLE oder so -->
A trend which is observable for this new wave of CV models, too.
They show a large potential to be the CV counterparts to NLP foundation models. <!-- ref Florence paper, ref models using CLIP as image encoder -->

## Concepts

### Scaling sample size

<!-- Reference to bitter pill to swallow: More compute beats complex architecture. -->
Arguably the most important aspect of these models is scale. <!-- ref to bitter pill to swallow -->
Making use of their available resources and the aggressive parallelization capabilities of transformer architectures, sample sizes range from 400 million [CLIP\; @radford2021learning] over 900 million [Florence\; @yuan2021florence] to 1.8 billion [ALIGN\; @jia2021scaling].
The datasets are obtained through web-scraping and, because of the use of natural language supervision, cost and labor intensive manual labeling is completely avoided.
But this readily available web-scale data comes with some drawbacks.
Because of its noisy nature, some form of pre-processing is needed, e.g., filtering for language, excluding graphic content and images with non-informative captions.
<!-- TODO: ALIGN doesn't filter this strongly -->

* Social biases are reproduced.

<!-- TODO: Other chapters discussing web-scale data? -->

### Contrastive loss

The maximizing scale approach explains a lot of further design choices.
The so called contrastive loss turned out to be very suitable for that.
* Ref to CLIP inspiration from medical field with contrastive objective formula
* Pro: Efficient training <!-- citation e.g., ALIGN -->
* Pro: Out of box zero shot -> can serve as _foundation model_ [@bommasani2021opportunities] <!-- ref to zero shot chapter -->
* Contra: No longer a generative model, e.g., no flexible caption generation
* Extra paper - but also in ALIGN?

### Zero shooting and foundation models

_Zero shooting_ is a paradigm coming from NLP research.
It means the previously fitted model is applied to a new, unseen dataset.
In a way each dataset can be seen as a different task and used to evaluate the models ability to perform it.
<!-- TODO: Name some datasets and their associated tasks. -->
This is done in order to avoid a bias in performance evaluation, where the model overfitted on the specific data-generating distribution.
<!-- TODO: Look up perfomance gain. -->
This is possible due to the flexible text encoding of CLIP.
<!-- TODO: Explain this better. -->
The model can readily function as a classifier by:

  1. Encoding all class labels.
  1. Predicting for an image, which encoded class label is most likely to come with it.

But in order to enhance performance by a margin of %d percent the prompts are engineered further.
They embed the class labels in sentence, e.g., "Picture of a (word)", which seemingly was necessary for the model to make full use of its learned parameters.

### Connecting image representations to language

* Semantic concepts
* Learn a representation _and_ connect it to language (-> NLP)
* Directly communicate visual concepts to the model like "picture" or "macro" or "drawing"

## CLIP

<!-- Intro -->
* Focus on _task learning_ (datasets as proxies to tasks) instead of _representation learning_
* Contrastive, Language, Image, Pre-training

### Architecture

* Original transformer with modifications used for GPT family as a text encoder
* ResNet or vision transformer as a image encoder.
  * Vision transformer: much less compute
* High parallelization capabilities (transformer)
* Can CLIP be seen as a step closer to human-like AI?
  * No: performance drop from zero- to one-shot setting
  * No: contrastive objective?
  * Yes: visual representations connected to natural language

## ALIGN

<!-- Intro -->
* Over one billion image alt-text pairs
* Name comes from alignment of visual and language representations trough the beloved and known contrastive loss or, very intuitively, "A Large-scale ImaGe and Noisy-text embedding"
* Dual encoder architecture
* Image + text image retrieval (e.g., Image of Eiffel tower + "snow" -> snowy Eiffel tower)
* Key difference to CLIP: training data. ALIGN does not filter that strongly, "dataset doesn't require expert knowledge to curate"

## Florence

<!-- Intro -->
<!-- Object detection vs scene level -->
* More fine-grained, dynamic, multimodal representations
* Focus shift to finding _foundation model_ as CLIP turned out to be especially useful for that.
  * Pre-trained core
  * Flexible addition of modules
    * _Dynamic Head_ for object detection - citations coming later
    * _METER_ as a adapter for vision-language (e.g., visual question answering)
    * Adaptation to video recognition through _CoSwin_
* General trend in this direction, better and better predictions [CoCa\; @yu2022coca]
* Optimization inside image-label-description space
* Encoders
  * Uses CLIP pendant as the language encoder
  * Swin transformer as the image encoder
  * CoSwin for embedding

### Architecture

## Performance comparison

* As all of these models are orders of magnitudes too large for performing a benchmark, findings reported inside the papers are believed here
<!-- TODO: Other comparisons -->

## Resources

One can find the pre-trained CLIP models on [Github](https://github.com/openai/CLIP).
They even found their way into simple command line tools already.
For example there is an application named [rclip](https://github.com/yurijmikhalevich/rclip), which can be used for personal image retrieval, wrapping the _ViT-B/32_ CLIP architecture.
On my (mid-range) laptop I was able to find seemingly good matches for search terms tried out inside a folder with about 100 pictures.
After an initial caching one request took about ten seconds.
<!-- TODO: Look up if data if available -->

## Outlook

CLIP as buildingblock
CLASP
LAION dataset
TODO: CLIP as module
